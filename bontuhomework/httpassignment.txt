HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is the foundation of data communication 
on the World Wide Web, defining how web browsers and servers communicate to exchange information. 
Essentially, it's a set of rules 
that dictate how web clients request and receive resources, like web pages, from servers.
