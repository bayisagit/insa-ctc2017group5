HTTP Documentation
Overview
HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the protocol for transferring data over the web. It defines how clients request resources from servers and how servers respond. HTTP is stateless, with each request independent of others. HTTPS is the secure, encrypted version.
HTTP Methods
HTTP methods define the action to perform on a resource. Below are the primary methods and their definitions:
1. GET
Retrieve data from a server without modifying it. Safe and idempotent.
2. POST
Send data to the server to create or update a resource. Not safe, not idempotent.
3. PUT
Update an existing resource or create one at a specific URL. Not safe, idempotent.
4. DELETE
Remove a resource from the server. Not safe, idempotent.
5. PATCH
Partially update a resource. Not safe, not always idempotent.
6. HEAD
Retrieve metadata about a resource without the response body. Safe and idempotent.
